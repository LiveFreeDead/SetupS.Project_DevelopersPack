Note: The goal is to have any additions/changes/options to NOT affect the original default
      behavior if not used or implemented (for backwards compatibility); but sometimes this is
      not always possible especially when adding new features.

v20.03.17.0 (March 17, 2020)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: [ssCore] A new variable %Resources% which resolves to/from "C:\Windows\Resources".
CHANGE: [ssEditor] The option "Activate Sendto Autobuild" now creates two shortcuts for
        autobuilding: one for Archive (.apz/.pgz) deployment package(s) and the other for Folder
        deployment package(s).
CHANGE: [ssCore] Shortcut definitions "Flags" can also recognize "#Is_x86#"/"#Is_x64#"
        (DualArch useage). This is in addition to "Is_x86"/"Is_x64" or "Is_86"/"Is_64".
FIX: [ssCore] Enabling the "Refresh Explorer" Shortcut Option would also select the
     "Desktop" Shortcut Location.

---------------------------------------------
v20.02.13.0 (Febuary 13, 2020)
---------------------------------------------
CHANGE: [SetupS] Removed functions not needed when using -Regen features. Speeds up LivePE

CHANGE: [ssCore] Shortcut definitions "Flags" now uses "Is_x86"/"Is_x64" (DualArch useage)
        for consistency and less confusion -- previously, had been "Is_86"/"Is_64" instead.

---------------------------------------------
v17.3.25.0 (March 25, 2017)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: [SetupS] New components for Windows unattended manipulation: %ClickMe%, %CloseMe%,
     %SelectMe%, %SendMe%, %WaitForMe%
ADD: [ssCore] New Shortcut definitions flag "AssemblyNoWait" to change the default behavor
     of Process Assembly so that assembly won't wait until a program or an installer
     finishes running or closes. This affects the new components above as well as
     %ProcessKill% and %WaitForIt%.
ADD: [ssEditor] AutoIt Window Information tool to ssEditor (Ctrl+I). Look for it in the
     menubar under Tools. Should be really handy for getting those Control-ID triad's
     for %ClickMe%.
ADD: [ssEditor] Windows Task Manager (Ctrl+T) to ssEditor's tool menu. Will be useful for
     both %ProcessKill% and %WaitForIt%.

---------------------------------------------
v17.3.20.0 (March 20, 2017)
---------------------------------------------
CHANGE: %WaitForIt% will additionally force SetupS to pause until a specific process is

        "Wait".

---------------------------------------------
v16.7.23.0 (July 23, 2016)
---------------------------------------------
CHANGE: [SetupS] Some tweaks to improve the self-queuing.
FIX: [SetupS] Issue in which the self-queuing could get "stuck".

v16.7.20.0 (July 20, 2016)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: [SetupS] Function to force SetupS to wait until all other occurrences of SetupS
     complete.
CHANGE: [ssCore] DualArch "Wait" parameter now defaults to "off" or "NoWait".
FIX: [ssPreinstaller] Using older/broken EnvUpdate() which was causing intermittent hangs.
FIX: [SetupS] During registry imports/merges, OSArch-gates (#Is_x86#/#Is_x64#) were being
     ignored with x86 ssApp-architectures, such as being installed to %ProgramFiles(x86)%.

---------------------------------------------
v16.6.10.0 (June 10, 2016)
---------------------------------------------
CHANGE: [ssEditor] Improvements to the Auto Silent Switch Finder (ASSF).

---------------------------------------------
CHANGE: Updated 7-Zip to v16.02

---------------------------------------------
CHANGE: [ssEditor] Improved deployment package filename filter for common illegal
        characters/symbols: \/:*?"<>|
CHANGE: [ssEditor] Calculated extracted install-size (for ppApps/ppGames) gets updated if
        size changes (only during builds or autobuilds -- not saves).

---------------------------------------------
v16.4.7.0 (April 7, 2016)
---------------------------------------------
FIX: [ssEditor] Calculated extracted install-size (for ppApps/ppGames) was being saved *after*
     the md5 file-hash calculations -- as a consequence the .app/.ppg file-hash would be off.

---------------------------------------------
v16.4.1.1 (April 1, 2016)
---------------------------------------------
FIX: [ssEditor] Problems caused by edge-case filenames being used with deployment packages.
     For example, a file named "Patch.job" would not get processed correctly because it
     matches one of the SetupS-file specs: "Patch.*"
FIX: [ssEditor] Logic errors involving various presence (or lack) of Patch folder-name usage.
     i.e. "ppApp\" vs. "Patch\" and if one or the other (or both) are used.

---------------------------------------------
v16.1.20.0 (January 20, 2016)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: Ability to reset tools' settings back to defaults (ssConfig, ssEditor, ssXFormer, ssCleaner).
CHANGE: Updated 7-Zip to v15.14
CHANGE: Improvements to the Auto Silent Switch Finder (ASSF).
FIX: Bugs involving the .app/.ppg file version info.
FIX: Line-endings with AddToHosts -- <Assembly>(internal) tool. v15.03.22.0 had only fixed the
     line-endings with the external tool.

---------------------------------------------
v15.12.21.0 (December 21, 2015)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: [ssEditor] Launch link(s) by clicking on "URL(s)" label/hotspot.

---------------------------------------------
ADD: Better support for Windows 10.
ADD: [ssControlPanel] Option to disable sorting/organizing the Default Startmenu shortcuts.
CHANGE: Update the tools (SetupS, ssEditor, etc.) to use the new revised SetupS File Spec to
        accommodate new OS (binary) flags that are still backwards compatible with current
        app & ppg files.
FIX: [ssEditor] The 7-Zip compression progress percentage quit working due to a change in
     the "add to archive" read-out format of the latest 7-Zip (v15.12).

---------------------------------------------
v15.11.30.0 (November 30, 2015)
---------------------------------------------
FIX: [SetupS, ssEditor, & Core] Several bugs involving the new Hotkey support for shortcut
     definitions.

---------------------------------------------
v15.11.29.1 (November 29, 2015)
---------------------------------------------
FIX: [ssEditor] Import Size function for Installed Size Meta-data was incorrectly reporting
     filesizes due to a change in the listing format of the latest 7-Zip (v15.12).
ADD: [ssEditor] Filesizes for SetupS Aux-files are also now included in the Installed Size
     Meta-data.

---------------------------------------------
v15.11.23.0 (November 23, 2015)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: Hotkey support for shortcut definitions. (Check Help-file for proper codes and syntax)
FIX: Shortcuts Start-in folder getting blanked when same as Install-to folder. Alternatively,
     the special path "." is also the same as the Install-to folder.
CHANGE: With the exception of filenames using the build-type scheme or the Install-to
        folder-name, ssEditor no longer automatically renames files to the filename scheme.
        This must be done manually now with the "Force Assign" function from the Graphics-tab.
CHANGE: ssEditor no longer automatically deletes identical files (with different file names).
        This must be done manually now (from Explorer).
CHANGE: Updated 7-Zip to v15.12

---------------------------------------------
v15.03.22.0 (March 22, 2015)
---------------------------------------------
FIX: Line-endings with AddToHosts (external tool).
FIX: Problem with ssEditor not resetting Flags in-between builds.
CHANGE: ssEditor now displays (and accepts) ppApp/ppGame "Installed Size" data with filesize
        byte-prefixes. For example, 50069604 Bytes becomes 47.75 MB (and vice versa).

---------------------------------------------
v15.03.15.0 (March 15, 2015)
---------------------------------------------
FIX: Fadertainer stalling on certain archives.
FIX: Legacy archives (using "SetupS.ini") not working.
FIX: Changed or missing Startup folder icon(s).

---------------------------------------------
v15.01.26.0 (January 26, 2015) - Glenn L. Chugg
---------------------------------------------
FIX: A bug with RunWait86 where regen stops on apps with no shortcuts specified. Caused by an
     empty/null $TempDir. Changed to the use of @TempDir instead which is never null.

---------------------------------------------
v14.11.6.0 (November 6, 2014) - Glenn L. Chugg
---------------------------------------------
FIX: A bug involving INIWrite that was creating random files in "C:\Windows".

---------------------------------------------
v14.5.0.0 (May 1, 2014)
---------------------------------------------
FIX: A bug extracting from .apz/.pgz files preventing ssEditor from opening them.
CHANGE: Uninstaller skips disabling ssUninstall if the feature is already disabled.
CHANGE: Updated help-file to reflect some of the recent changes.

---------------------------------------------
v14.4.0.0 (April 8, 2014)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: New feature/option, called "ssUninstall", for automatic ssCleaning after uninstalling an
     App or Game that was installed with SetupS.
FIX: Use of wild cards to extract from .apz/.pgz files were missing the subfolders contained

         -Path=Add|Del
FIX: Broken v14.1.31.0 -- was no longer locating the "Tools" folder.

---------------------------------------------
v14.1.27.0 (January 27, 2014)
---------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------
v14.1.17.0 (January 17, 2014)
---------------------------------------------
FIX: Minor bug involving any removable-media drive such as a card-reader or a usb one that
     happens to have the same drive-letter as might be used for the Linux home drive (z:).

---------------------------------------------
v14.1.14.0 (January 14, 2014)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: New functions to facilitate getting updates for the external ppApp SetupS tools such as
     ssCleaner, ssXFormer, ssGooey, and ssFATSorter.

---------------------------------------------
ADD: Ability to change the order of where to get updates from the list of alternate
     distribution sites.
ADD: SetupS (ssApp-version only) added to the Path environment variable for
     Run-dialogs/Command-windows.
ADD: New ssCleaner switches (DudInstallPaths|NotDudInstallPaths, or DeepScan|NoDeepScan) for
     the folder removal functions. Multiple settings are comma-separated, like so:
         -ssClean=StartMenuOnly,NoDeepScan
CHANGE: The check for removed Startmenu items is now a separate option from the type of
        ssClean (for either StartmenuOnly or AllShortcuts). This option simply allows for
        automatic ssCleaning whenever shortcuts are removed such as during Startmenu Style
        changes.

---------------------------------------------
v13.12.1.0 (December 1, 2013)
---------------------------------------------
CHANGE: Some minor improvements.

---------------------------------------------
v13.11.27.1 (November 27, 2013)
---------------------------------------------

     including empty folders. Set via the SetupS ControlPanel or through a command-line switch
     for SetupS, ssRegenerator, ssControlPanel, or ssCleaner. CLI Syntax:
         -KeepStartmenuFolders[=Yes|No]: Default=No

---------------------------------------------
v13.11.9.2 (November 10, 2013)
---------------------------------------------
FIX: Minor bug with the "#Is_Metro#" gate.
ADD: #Is_NT..# alias for the #Is_OS..# gates.

---------------------------------------------
v13.11.9.1 (November 9, 2013)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: New comparative gates for Windows OS versions. For example, "#Is_OS>=5##Is_OS<6#" is
     exactly the equivalent of "#Is_NT5#".
ADD: New gate for Windows OS versions using StartScreen (Metro): #Is_Metro#.
CHANGE: ssEditor Shortcut(s) options now references "StartScreen-friendly" rather than
        "Metro-friendly".

---------------------------------------------
FIX: ssEditor was not saving changes to the "Metro-friendly" shortcut flag.
FIX: A minor bug with ssEditor and certain changes it makes to the external script/registry
     files but not showing those changes in the built-in edit-boxes.
CHANGE: ssEditor's View "Source in Notepad" now saves any edits done there.

---------------------------------------------
v13.10.28.0 (October 28, 2013)
---------------------------------------------
FIX: Legacy ppApps/ppGames, if Architecture=0 (any), would install as
     Architecture=1 (x86) regardless if it truely was x86-only.

---------------------------------------------
v13.10.24.0 (October 24, 2013)
---------------------------------------------
FIX: Disabled icon extraction in ssEditor for WINE versions older than 1.7.5.

---------------------------------------------
v13.10.22.1 (October 22, 2013)
---------------------------------------------
CHANGE: Re-enabled MD5 checksum calculations for WINE versions 1.7 or better (due to the
        recent fix in WINE for the crypto functions).
FIX: Bug that was introduced with the context-menu help additions to ssControlPanel.

---------------------------------------------
v13.10.17.1 (October 19, 2013)
---------------------------------------------
CHANGE: Linux (via WINE) support reintroduced. So far only the Fadertainer is disabled if
        running SetupS from such an environment. Also there's some issues remaining with ssEditor.
CHANGE: Combined help files into a single resource which will be much easier to maintain.
        Plus, there were many duplicated references before.

---------------------------------------------
v13.9.30.0 (September 30, 2013)
---------------------------------------------
CHANGE: Minor improvements and bug fixes.

FIX: Under certain conditions the patch folder (named "Patch") would get copied to the
     installed-to path as well as its contents.
FIX: Deleting items was defaulting to the Recycle-Bin.
CHANGE: Reverted back to the old method of seeking SetupS files (.app/ppg, .apz/.ppg, etc.).
CHANGE: Re-enabled logging/debugging options.
FIX: An extra check added to validate shortcuts listed in the keep list.
FIX: SetupS Temp files get deleted instead of sent to the recycle bin.

---------------------------------------------
v13.7.17 (July 17, 2013)
---------------------------------------------
FIX: Gate filters are applied only to external registry files listed in Assembly. External
     scripts listed in Assembly are run "as is" without any modification (variable
     substitutions, gate directives, etc.)

---------------------------------------------
v13.7.16 (July 16, 2013)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: Uninstall section for ssEditor.

CHANGE: Improved detection of installed architecture version (for ssApps only).
CHANGE: Improvements to the x64 version of SetupS in the handling of Registry entries with

FIX: Problem(s) adding tags using ssEditor.
FIX: Issue with SetupS & ssCleaner incorrectly detecting which applications or games have been

---------------------------------------------
ADD: Ability to download updates from alternate distribution sites.
CHANGE: Resurrected categories: Puzzle, Arcade, Card, Board, Dice, Music, Physics.

CHANGE: Fadertainer's selection of default fader (if app/game is missing one)
CHANGE: Only the ShortcutS-keep list will be used to determine which shortcut(s) get set if
        the KeepAll flag is not set. If that list is empty, then it will be set from the
        first shortcut def listed (default). As before, for specialized shortcut locations
        the first one listed in the ShortcutS-keep list will be created.

---------------------------------------------
ADD: Multiple screen-shots support.
ADD: 2 new switches/parameters to ssEditor:

---------------------------------------------
ADD: Ability to forward/redirect Category entries (similarly to how it's done with the
     Startmenu Catalog).
ADD: Default fader listing for the Category entries for apps/games that don't include one.
CHANGE: If game is selected, then ssEditor hides the "Game" prefixes from Category and

FIX: SetupS not copying .reg/.cmd files to the Install-path from archive packages (.apz/.pgz).
FIX: An infinite-recursion bug with the startmenu destination validation functions.

---------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------
ADD: A new Metro-friendly app-variable that if Windows 8 is detected will over-ride the 'Keep
     in folder' and 'Keep all' flags to instead place shortcuts from the 'Shortcut names to
     keep' list or if that's empty, then to use the first ShortcutS definition listed.
ADD: A new section called [Meta] (or <Meta>) for both the legacy and INI file formats with the
     following new keys: Tags, Publisher, Language, Releaser, Additional, Rating, RequiredDX,
     ReleaseDate, LicenseType, InstalledSize.
ADD: A new ssEditor function to calculate InstalledSize info based on the ppInstall-archives
    (which must be present). Only works reliably with ppGames or Dual-arch ppApps.

---------------------------------------------
ADD: Ability to forward/redirect Category entries (similarly to how it's done with the

CHANGE: Reorganized/cleaned-up the various distribution packages.

        or ssCP. This was done mainly to accommodate the tools used with the ssWPI update
        package.

     NOT update an .app/.pgz-file even if changes are found or detected.
FIX: ssEditor bugs with saving New (and with SaveAs) files from a template.
CHANGE: Windows 8 is unsupported at the moment; so expect many features to either be

---------------------------------------------
ADD: SetupS/ssEditor shortcut locations: TaskbarPin & StartmenuPin. Pinning only works with

     Installed-to paths to be ignored and not get deleted when they should be.
FIX: A bug with the ssCleaner function where if it found any shortcut without a target that
     entire app got deleted. For example, a shortcut to a missing help file.
CHANGE: Linux support dropped. Temporary for now until there is more progress on better
        cross-platform connectivity (such as with WINE).

---------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------
FIX: ssEditor bug when cancelling from a Build then the form didn't unlock the other
     functions/buttons.

     or ppGames.
FIX: With Windows 7, SetupS would incorrectly only process the last entry in a list of fonts
     in <InstallFonts>.
FIX: A problem with SetupS installing itself with a pre-set Advanced Startmenu would
     erroneously change its default Startmenu (<StartMenuSourcePath>) in the .app-file
     resulting in bogus Startmenus during a regen or re-sort.

---------------------------------------------
v8.12.10.0 (October 10, 2012) RC10
---------------------------------------------
ADD: New function for ssEditor to save current file/package in another location. Now any
     SetupS package can serve as a template for a new one. (See "File, Save As" from the
     menu-bar.)
CHANGE: Creating a new .app-file  with ssEditor -- menubar "File, New" or Ctrl+N -- now asks
        for new folder locations and/or overwrite confirmations if there are any conflicts.
        For example, file already exists or working folder is the %AppPath%, etc.
CHANGE: Updated innounp.exe from v0.17 to v0.37 for ssEditor.
FIX: Bug when browsing for SetupS aux-files (icons, faders, or screen-shots) and assigning
     them to the package, it didn't copy the files to the working folder.

---------------------------------------------
v8.12.9.0 (September 26, 2012) RC9
---------------------------------------------
ADD: A new .app-file definition for <Architecture>: "3 (DualArch)". This will only apply to
     ppApps/ppGames, because of their unique capabilities. The default behavior for
     ppApps/ppGames with "DualArch-Installers" will now be exactly the same as that of ssApps
     -- they'll simply install the single-OSArch package of the target  system. The default
     behavior is whenever <Architecture> is either omitted or set to "0 (Any)". Note: This
     will not greatly impact any existing ppApps. Those that are full dualArch only need to
     add "3 (DualArch)" under <Architecture> to maintain the original behavior; otherwise, the
     new default will be used instead.

---------------------------------------------
ADD: ssEditor now supports creating archives and files using RAR. Simply select the option

---------------------------------------------
ADD: Autocomplete for <AppPath>. In addition to shortcut searching, SetupS also uses the
     Uninstall section of the Registry to determine where the App is actually installed.
     Failing all these, if it cannot determine the actual install folder then it will attempt
     to derive one from the other information in the .app-file.
ADD: Autocomplete for <StartMenuSourcePath> -- not very refined at this time.
ADD: GPL licensing information/notification for the SetupS Control Panel and ssEditor.
CHANGE: "Safe Install" enabled by default.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.7.31 (July 31, 2011) Transcendental
---------------------------------------------
ADD: New SetupS Control Panel shortcuts for resorting the Startmenu.
FIX: Items missing from the Developers' Pack.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.7.29 (July 29, 2011) Transatlantic
---------------------------------------------
CHANGE: Now creates the <AppPath> folder specified in the .app-file but only after exhausting
        all the other attempts to find the true <AppPath>.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.7.27 (July 27, 2011) Tangential
---------------------------------------------
ADD: Self-update (via SetupS Control Panel). Can also issue "-AutoUpdate=Yes".
FIX: The (SFX) installer was leaving behind temp files.
FIX: Reporting/Notifications not being immediately set.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.7.20 (July 20, 2011) Transgenic
---------------------------------------------
FIX: Bug when disabling the Fadertainer option "Always On Top".

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.7.17 (July 17, 2011) Lunar
---------------------------------------------
ADD: A preview indicator of the Startmenu path for shortcuts. Reflects the the current
     Starmenu style (Standard or Advanced) and also the "KeepInFolder" flag. [ssEditor]
FIX: A glitch between the <Catalog> to <StartmenuDestPath> conversion.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.7.11 (July 11, 2011) Equilibrium
---------------------------------------------
FIX: A minor bug in which more than one install archive is being utilized for ppApps or ppGames.
FIX: A possible problem where ssEditor erroneously renames a program's archive into the
     Buildtype one.
CHANGE: Improvements to the GetToolsFolder function -- more robust dual-arch capabilities (and
        less buggy).

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.7.7 (July 7, 2011) Final Redux
---------------------------------------------
FIX: Annoying bug where the current Startmenu style is set to standard/default but the
     advanced Startmenu support files are still being used which caused a crash whenever those
     files were missing or not present (such as in an SFX-archive).

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.7.1 (July 1, 2011) Final 1
---------------------------------------------
ADD: Instituted GNU General Public License (GPLv3) licensing for the entire SetupS SendTo Suite.
ADD: New Startmenu Catalog called "Installing" (alias is also "System Installing").
ADD: Folder icon for "All Users" Startup.
CHANGE: The Startmenu Catalog for SetupS SendTo Suite is now "System Installing" (previously
        it was "Development Setup & Installing")
CHANGE: The Install-to (AppPath) for SetupS SendTo Suite is now "%ProgramFiles%\SetupS.SendTo"
        (previously it was "%ProgramFiles%\SetupSetupS").
FIX: Minor bug where current advanced menu style was ignored if both <Catalog> and
     <StartMenuDestPath> are missing.
FIX: A potential bug where the DualArch function cannot find the x64 version.
FIX: Vertical scrolling for ssEditor's Shortcut Definitions Display Name dropbox when there is
     more than 30 or so shortcuts defined.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.6.7 (June 7, 2011) RC8
---------------------------------------------
CHANGE: Process sequence for ssInstall always occurs before the directives #CMD# (or #DOS#).
        As with the other #Directives#, this is to allow the use of the install-to path (or
        <AppPath>) as it is often not created nor determined until after ssInstall has been
        run.
CHANGE: Improved the automatic silent switch detection for ssEditor.
CHANGE: Integrated the tools for ssEditor.
FIX: Checkboxes not working properly with ssEditor's context-sensitive F1-help.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.5.30 (May 30, 2011) RC7
---------------------------------------------
ADD: Implemented context-sensitive F1-help for ssEditor.
FIX: (Corrected) Prevent extraction of archives already located at the <AppPath>. (ie, with
      the "-Regen" switch)
CHANGE: ssEditor GUI cosmetics.
CHANGE: To help with the problems of undesired archive extraction(s), a filenaming "standard"
        will be enforced for install-archives -- similarly to how the faders and screenshots
        are already handled, like so:
            {BuildType}.7z|.rar|.zip|.cab (ie, ssApp.7z, ppApp.rar, etc.)
            {SourceFolderName}.7z|.rar|.zip|.cab (ie, CCleaner_v3_x86_ppApp.7z,
                 CCleaner_v3_x86_ppApp.rar, etc.)
            {InstallPath}.7z|.rar|.zip|.cab (ie, CCleaner.7z, CCleaner.rar, etc.)
        The exception to this will be with "legacy" ppGames which are detected by their lack
        of <BuildType> tags.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.5.22 (May 22, 2011) RC6
---------------------------------------------
FIX: Fadertainer disabled for Linux.
FIX: Network error(s) with network cardless systems such as a LivePE or Linux.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.5.18 (May 18, 2011) RC5
---------------------------------------------
ADD: Preferences/Options now persistent between re-installs/updates.
     [SetupS/ssEditor]

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.5.12 (May 12, 2011) RC4
---------------------------------------------
ADD: New <Flag> called 'NoneThing' to prevent (or remove) SetupS related files. Basically,
     this prevents creation of the Aux files (screenshot, fader, etc.), advanced startmenu
     shortcuts, folder icons, and the .app-file.
     This also means that the app will be rendered invisible or nonexistent to SetupS and
     ssWPI. [SetupS/ssEditor (Post-processing options)]
FIX: "Vanishing" ssEditor Sendto shortcut.
FIX: (Corrected) Linux via WINE "Type needs to be an Object" error.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.5.8 (May 8, 2011) RC3
---------------------------------------------
ADD: SetupS Option for "Safe Installs" (incomplete). Default is "off". Related switch:
     "--SafeInstall=On"
ADD: New directive for the <Assembly> section:
        #ApplyPatch# : Apply patch archives/folders.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.5.2 (May 2, 2011) RC2
---------------------------------------------
ADD: SendTo shortcuts of SetupS apps/games to ssEditor to edit their respective .app/.ppg file
     (for example, a Desktop shortcut).
ADD: Option to ssEditor for adding Autobuild to the Sendto menu.
CHANGE: Windows Media Player (advanced) StartMenu now cataloged as "Video" instead of
        "Multimedia"
ADD: New directives for the <Assembly> section:
        #Is_NT5# : Process this line for NT5.x OS's only (Windows 2000/XP/2003).
        #Is_NT6# : Process this line for NT6.x OS's only (Windows Vista/7/2008).
     Note: These can be at the beginning or at the end of each line. For example:
         <Install>
             "7z920.msi" /qb #Is_NT6#
             "7z920.exe" /S #Is_NT5#

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.4.16 (April 16, 2011) RC1
---------------------------------------------
ADD: 'View Source in Notepad' for ssEditor (F4).
CHANGE: Button Wingding fonts to graphic icons for ssEditor.
CHANGE: The troublesome environment variables %USERNAME% and %COMPUTERNAME% substitutions are
        re-instated with some limitations. Conversions of %variable% to real-world data are
        unhindered as before but real-world data to %variable% has been reigned-in by
        delimiting them with either double quote characters (") or slash characters (\). So
        with these two environment variables, be aware that there may still be some incomplete
        conversions from real-world data to their %variable% equivalents when using ssEditor.
FIX: 'Cancel' aborts exiting ssEditor for non-saved .app's.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.3.33 (April 3, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: New <Flag> called 'AllUsers' to create shortcut(s) for "AllUsers" instead of "Current
     User" using the other location flags such as StartMenu, Desktop, SendTo, etc. NOTE: This
     flag defaults to 'Yes' when not in use.
ADD: Option for ssEditor to "Get Version from Title". Default = off.
CHANGE: 'MakeInRoot' <Flag> to create shortcut(s) for "Start Menu" root rather than
        "Programs". Instead, use 'MakeInPrograms' to create shortcut(s) for "Start
        Menu\Programs".
CHANGE: Optimized the scanning routine for ssApp, ppApps, and ppGames. Tools like Regenerator
        will have improved speeds for folders with large number of files & folders such as
        "C:\Windows".
CHANGE: Lines with first-character-semi-colons in .app-files are no longer ignored.
FIX: 'MakeInStartMenu' erroneously getting set to 'Yes' instead of 'No' during .app-file
     writes/saves.
FIX: %Username% and %ComputerName% variable substitutions DROPPED. Instead, use %UserProfile%
     or %HomePath%.
FIX: Shortcut moving/removing from the (Standard/Advanced) Startmenu from both "AllUsers" or
     "Current User".
FIX: ssEditor always incorrectly setting 'AllUsers' to 'Yes'.
FIX: ssEditor not capturing shortcut info when using sendto on executable .exe's or shortcut
     .lnk's.
FIX: ssEditor crash on Exit & Save.
FIX: For the unattended self-installing ssApp package, SetupS is now run post-install in
     Regen-mode. Hopefully this will correct the occasional failures to install SetupS itself.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.3.21 (March 21, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: New switch called "-Regenerate" (or just "-Regen") that will force that function on any
     folder/file passed to SetupS. For example:
        SetupS x:\ppAppsLive -Regen
ADD: New directives/variables for the <Assembly> section:
        #RegisterDLL# : Process the <RegisterDLL> section. Skips it during Post-processing.
        #InstallFonts# : Process the <InstallFonts> section. Skips it during Post-processing.
        #CMD# : Process this line as a command-line using the DOS console (aka, the
                Command-line Interpreter). Note: This can be at the beginning or at the end of
                each line. For example:
                    <Install>
                        md "%ProgramFiles%\Something" #CMD#
ADD: Fadertainer uses category faders for apps/games without faders.
ADD: OSARCH filters to "MenuDefaults.ini" for Default StartMenu sorting (Standard/Advanced).
ADD: The ability to insert the directives and components into ssEditor's assembly order box.
CHANGE: Use of "Yes|No" instead of "True|False" in writing the <Flags> sections to the
        .app-files.
CHANGE: External .cmd/.bat & .reg files are no longer (automatically) integrated into their
        respective sections (ie, <Script> or <Registry>) when said sections are empty.
CHANGE: Re-writing of the .app file is no longer performed during "regenerate-type" operations.
CHANGE: No re-created folder-icons for startmenu & install-to folders if they exist already.
CHANGE: No re-writing if desktop.ini (folder icons) is Read-only.
CHANGE: No re-writing if .app-file is Read-only.
CHANGE: Capped the maximum size of faders for the Fadertainer to 256 (on either axis).
CHANGE: WorkingDir/StartIn folder for shortcuts set to target folder.
FIX: ssApp "self-install" package crashed during fresh installs.
FIX: Standard (default) menu was using ssTek style & structures.
FIX: Corrupted .app files at the install-to <AppPath> locations.
FIX: ssEditor crashed when StartMenu style was set to Standard/default.
FIX: Install-to path was not being checked before post-install processes.
FIX: If the KeepInFolder flag was turned off then all defined shortcuts always got created
     regardless what the KeepAll flag was set to.
FIX: Advanced menu not completely removed when StartMenu style was set to Standard/default.
FIX: An issue with AlwaysSort flag forcing ALL subsequent apps installed or regenerated into
     using the ssTek advanced startmenu style.
FIX: 'MenuDefaults.ini' missing an entry for the 32-bit Internet Explorer shortcut on x64
     systems.
FIX: Several issues caused by apps or games without a Category "declared".
FIX: Legacy to Catalog based advanced startmenus made "smarter"
FIX: Crash when no selection is made with the file-open dialog.
FIX: Update "Install-to Path" and "Default Menu" mirror-labels with changes to their
     respective inputboxes.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.2.21 (February 21, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: ssWPI Option "AlwaysHide" flag.
CHANGE: Regenerator Option for scanning all drives defaults to "off". This was far too risky
        to default "on" because of the possible existence of portable and mapped network
        drives. So exercise caution when enabling this!
FIX: Error box no longer shows when folders such as ppApps, ppGames, ssAppsInstalls, etc. were
     actually empty of any files or folders.
FIX: More Startmenu "Definitions.ini" problems.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.2.19 (February 19, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
FIXED: "Desktop.ini" for Startup folder gets copied to the StartMenu during Advanced menu
        installs.
FIXED: "Definitions.ini" for both Kazz & ssTek as follows:
    Changed:
        ssTek:
            "Graphics Designing = - Graphics\- CAD & Vector" --> "Graphics Designing = -Graphics\- Tools & Design"
            "- Internet\- Network and Bandwidth Software" --> "- Internet\- Network & Bandwidth Software"
    Added:
        ssTek:
            Graphics Tools = - Graphics\- Tools & Design
            Security Cracking = - Development\- Hacking & Hex\- Cracks
            Security Workarounds = - Development\- Hacking & Hex\- Workarounds
        Kazz:
            Graphics Tools =  6 Graphics\6 CAD & Advanced Design
            Security Cracking = 9 Other\2 Hacking & Workarounds\1 Cracks
            Security Workarounds = 9 Other\2 Hacking & Workarounds

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.2.17 (February 17, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
FIX: ssApp Installer package to better handle the special case where SetupS is updating or installing itself.
FIX: Removed the empty "ssTek" tools\menu folder from the ssWPI Update Package.
CHANGE: A few minor cosmetics.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.2.15 (February 15, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: SetupS Control Panel has Regenerator Option for scanning all drives. Caution: this enables scans of portable
     and mapped network drives! Alternatively, use the switch:
        -AllDrives=Yes|No : Default=No

ADD: New variables/directives:
        %ssTekResources% : for "%WinDir%\ssTek" (ie, "C:\Windows\ssTek").

        %AddToHosts% {IP address} {host name} : Sets mappings of IP addresses to host names.
            For example:
            %AddToHosts% "127.0.0.1 secure.example.com"

        %Extract% {archive} -o{destination path} : Extract an archive to a specified destination path. Exactly
            equivalent to: '7z x -y -aoa {archive} -o{destination path}'
                For example:
                %Extract% "Extras.rar" -o"%SystemRoot%\ssTek"
                    becomes...
                7z.exe x -y -aoa "Extras.rar" -o"C:Windows\ssTek"

ADD: New directives for the <Assembly> section:
        #Is_x86# : Process this line for 32-bit OS-Architectures (x86) only.
        #Is_x64# : Process this line for 64-bit OS-Architectures (x64) only.
     Note: These can be at the beginning or at the end of each line. For example:
         <Install>
             "7z920-x64.msi" /qb #Is_x64#
             "7z920.exe" /S #Is_x86#

CHANGE: Create StartMenus on the fly only from its Definitions.ini file -- independent of the Layout SFX or archive.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.2.12 (February 12, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: Fadertainer Option for use "During Installs Only" (Regenerator-only option). Use the switch:
        -FaderInstallsOnly=Yes|No : Default=Yes
ADD: Esc-key aborts Fadertainer.
CHANGE: Fadertainer active (if enabled) during .apz/.pgz file extractions.
CHANGE: Prevent Fadertainer (and installers) from stealing focus.
FIX: Shortcut definitions "StartIn" path omitted if it's merely a duplicate of <AppPath>.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.2.10 (February 10, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: Fadertainer Option for use "Always On Top". Use the switch:
        -FaderOnTop=Yes|No : Default=Yes
ADD: Support for Fadertainer-Modules.
CHANGE: Use "default.png" for those without one.
CHANGE: Filename from "SetupS.Shortcuts.Generator.exe" to just "Regenerator.exe".
FIX: Miscellaneous minor (and rare) bugs. I.e., Truncated paths with Shortcut definitions, <AppPath> obtained from
     temp folders, etc.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.2.9 (February 9, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
[All]
ADD: More Options for Fadertainer such as Speed and Location on screen. Switches to use:
        -Fadertainer=On|Off : Default = Off
        -FaderSpeed={seconds} : Number of seconds to Fade in or fade out. Default=.5. IE, -FaderSpeed=.3
        -FaderLocation=TL|TC|TR|ML|MC|MR|BL|BC|BR : T=Top, L=Left, R=Right, C=Center, M=Middle, B=Bottom

ADD: 'Always On Top' option for Splash Text Reporting/Notifications
        -SplashOnTop=Yes|No : Default = No

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.2.7 (February 7, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS]
CHANGE: More checks to find a valid or complete install-to path <AppPath> especially for x64 ones.
FIX: Use the system temp folder if ssApp does not have a valid or complete install-to path <AppPath>.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.2.5 (February 5, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
[All]
CHANGE: Reorganized Core to better facilitate "SetupS Control Panel" and "SetupS Regenerator" into becoming
        standalone utilities by themselves at a later date.

[SetupS Regenerator / SetupS Editor]
FIX: Some problems with the GUI's (SetupS Control Panel & ssEditor)

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.2.4 (February 4, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS]
ADD: New option for activating the Fadertainer to the "Reporting/Notifications" preferences.
CHANGE: Attributes of any temp-files/folders are toggled-off from Readonly/System/Hidden; and set working folder to
        the SetupS working folder before deleting temp-files/folders.

[SetupS.Shortcuts.Generator/SetupS Regenerator]
Rechristened the "Shortcuts Generator" to "Regenerator" because it is much more than that now.

[SetupS.Control.Panel]
CHANGE: Added checkbox for above mentioned Fadertainer option.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.1.31 (February 2, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS/SetupS.Shortcuts.Generator/SetupS Control Panel]
ADD: New option(s) to process ssApps, ppApps, or ppGames without creating shortcuts.
CHANGE: Internal archive with parent-folder name (legacy) is not copied to the Install-path folder.
FIX: Bug where <Architecture> is set to x64 if Runx64 flag is present regardless of its setting.

[SetupS.Control.Panel]
CHANGE: An overhaul of the SetupS.Control.Panel GUI (converting it to a Koda form).

[SetupS Editor]
CHANGE: If Install-path is incomplete, then an attempt is made to determine it based on Build-type.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.1.30 (January 30, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS/Core]
CHANGE: %CDROM% / %CDDrive% is searched for only when either of those variables are used and the priority is to
        first search for those drives with ssWPIcd.ini file and then failing that to search for any system optical
        drives.

CHANGE: Substitution of the 'Regsrv /s' command instead of the API-calls for <RegistryDLL> items.

ADD: Tools Subfolders for OSArch specific tools such as 7-Zip, AddonInstaller, etc.

CHANGE: Scripts (.cmd/.bat files) listed in <Install> now accept the .reg file name alone by itself. It is no
        longer necessary to use "regedit /s", "regedit.exe /s" and "reg import" in front of it; but still okay to
        use such if so desired. Also works for the <Script> section and any external "BuildType.cmd|bat" files as
        well.

CHANGE: When reading in .app/.ppg files, a reverse lookup of string values into variables is performed. For
        example: "C:\Program Files" becomes --> "%ProgramFiles%". This should take care of those cases where
        value(s) are "hard-coded" into the .app-file rather than using the %Variables% and in some case where those
        values are not found.

CHANGE: Extra check for the possibility of the install folder being located elsewhere than that listed in <AppPath>
        independent of the actual architecture. A shortcut scan will occur only when <AppPath> is either blank or
        bogus and only if there any shortcuts created by the installer and <StartMenuSourcePath> is valid.

FIX: Path and working folder issues with the various kinds of script handling SetupS is now capable of.

[SetupS.Control.Panel]
Removal of the Optical drive selection as it is no longer needed. See above.

[SetupS/SetupS.Shortcuts.Generator/SetupS Control Panel]
ADD: Switch -ppGamesShortcutsSkip to force SetupS to skip ppGame Shortcut processing.

[SetupS Editor]
CHANGE: Break/abort for creating archives is now <Ctrl>+<Alt>+<ESC>, instead of simply <ESC>.
        This should help prevent the abort of a build inadvertently if ssEditor is running in
        the background while some other application or task is simultaneously in use.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.1.22 (January 22, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS/Core]
ADD: New directives/variables for the <Assembly> section:
        #ApplyRegistry# : Apply the <Registry> section. Skips it during Post-processing.
        #RunScript# : Run the <Script> section with the Source folder as the 'Start In' or
        working folder. Skips it during Post-processing.
        %AddonInstaller% [path\filename] : Process Addons such as ones from Kel or RyanVM.
        %WaitForIt% [path\filename] : Force SetupS to pause until a specific file is created
        or copied to that location. Shortcut files (.lnk) are recommended because they are
        often created last by installers.
        %ProcessKill% [filename] : To force a process/task to close from a given filename.
            For example:
               %ProcessKill% "Notepad.exe"
               %TaskKill% [filename] : Same as %ProcessKill% above.

CHANGE: Process registry files (.reg) listed within <Assembly> sections just like is done in
        the <Registry> sections. For example, environment (ie, %SystemRoot%) and SetupS
        (ie, %ppApps%) variable substitutions are now handled the same way. Simply list the
        file only. It will be the equivalent of "reg import [file.reg]" or "regedit /s [file.reg]".
        For example:
            <Install>
                ImportTest.reg

CHANGE: For the dual architecture function, the 32-bit version now attempts to search for its 64-bit
        counterpart(_x64).

FIX: Rewrote the patch folder/archive handling to work correctly and be more robust now.

FIX: Miscellaneous other bugs.

[SetupS Editor]
CHANGE: Enable editing of <Preprocessing> for ppApps/ppGames.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.1.20 (January 20, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS/Core]
FIX: SetupS archive handling to fallback on ANY archive(s) if none of the standard ones were found (applies to
     ppApps or ppGames only).

[SetupS Editor]
ADD: Option for 7z process priority during Build(s). Set using the Build Options menu or use the switch:
    -7zProcessPriority=0|1|2|3|4|5 : 0=Idle/Low, 1=Below Normal, 2=Normal, 3=Above Normal, 4=High, 5=Realtime.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.1.19 (January 19, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS/Core]
FIX: Archive handling to specifically handle ALL Setups-related (source only) archives such that any other archives
     will get ignored. The previous attempt only handled the first one it encountered.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.1.18 (January 18, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS]
CHANGE: Archive handling to specifically handle only Setups-related (source only) archives such that any other
        archives will get ignored.
FIX: Non-detection of .msi files.

[SetupS Editor]
ADD: Option to Delete Source folders/files for Express Installer Builds only (.apz/.pgz). Set using the Build
     Options menu or use the switch:
         -DeleteSource=off|on
ADD: Editbox for Shortcut definitions 'Start In' folder.
CHANGE: No Previews if -Autobuild is used.
CHANGE: Removed selectable output folder. Too problematic and buggy at this time.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.1.17 (January 17, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS Core]
CHANGE: Improved dynamic array redimensioning.

[SetupS]
CHANGE: Improved handling of Patch folders and archives to be more useful by moving their operations to just after
        the install operations but immediately before the shortcut handling ones.
CHANGE: Process scripts (.cmd/.bat) listed within <Assembly> sections just like is done in the
        <Script> sections. For example, environment (ie, %SystemRoot%) and SetupS (ie, %ppApps%) variable
        substitutions are now handled the same way.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.1.15 (January 15, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS]
CHANGE: Internal archives (ie, ppApp.7z, Patch.7z, etc.) do not get copied to the install folder.
CHANGE: Checks first to see if the font files are already present in the install folder and install them.
        Otherwise, installs from the source folder.
FIX: Bug/typo where the wrong array was being used for <RegisterDLL>.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.1.14 (January 14, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
[Project]
CHANGED: Updated Inno Setup to v5.4.0 to compile the installer.

[SetupS]
CHANGED: Added a check at the install path to make sure the files listed under <RegisterDLL> are actually present.
         If not, then copies them from the source folder.

[SetupS Core/ALL]
CHANGE: Moved functions only being used with one app (SetupS, SetupS.Shortcuts.Generator, SetupS.Control.Panel, and
        SetupS.Editor) to that app using it. This is to combat the bloat creep that was occurring.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.1.13 (January 13, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS Editor]
ADD: Embedded previews for folder icons and faders (similar to screenshot).
CHANGED: Improved popups for screenshot, faders, and icons (ie, quicker).

[SetupS Core/ALL]
CHANGE: Removed functions no longer being used -- mostly for the changes to picture support (see above).

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.1.12 (January 12, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS Core/ALL]
CHANGE: Permanently delete rather than Recycle the install files used with ppApps/ppGames, such as archives,
        checksums, and patch folders.
FIX: Miscellaneous bugs.

---------------------------------------------
v8.11.1.11 (January 11, 2011)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS Core/ALL]
ADD: <RegisterDLL> section. List any DLL/OCX to Register post-install. Equivalent to:
    >REGSVR32 /s "%AppPath%\This.DLL"
ADD: <Preprocessing> section for ppApps & ppGames. Identical to <Install> for ssApps but this section is processed
     just before "installing" a ppApp/ppGame.
CHANGE: <InstallFonts> section is now implemented.
CHANGE: <Category> section now accepts multiple categories. Simply separate each with a pipe (|). For ppGames, only
        the first category is used for StartMenu sub-folders.
FIX: Minor bug with Patch folder/archive processing.

[SetupS Editor]
CHANGED: Layout to use Tabsheets.
ADD: Support for the new <RegisterDLL> section
ADD: Support for the <InstallFonts> section.
CHANGE: Support for multiple categories with <Category> section.
CHANGE: Updated to Filenaming Standard for <OS>.

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.12.31 (December 31, 2010)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS Editor]
FIX: Bugs related to ppTweaks. Ie, the handling of empty ppApp.7z archives.
FIX: Logic error for scanning folders/files for .apz/.pgz files (they need to be excluded during autobuild).

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.12.23 (December 23, 2010)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS Editor]
ADD: Option to archive the Patch folder. Use:
     -PatchCompress=off|on :Whether or not you want to use archives for the Patch-folders.
CHANGE: Better compression filters for the .apz/.pgz archives.
FIX: Minor bugs.

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.12.19 (December 19, 2010)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS Editor]
CHANGE: Substituted YumeYao�s optimized VC7 recompiled 7-Zip v9.20
CHANGE: Cosmetics on message box(es)

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.12.18 (December 18, 2010)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS Editor]
ADD: Autobuild capability. Merely right-click Sendto "ssEditor(Autobuild)" and it will build your deployment
     package based on your ssEditor default settings. It even will scan through folders for SetupS recognized
     files or folders to do batch or "mass"-building. NOTE: Remember to change your defaults before using Sendto by
     opening ssEditor first and set 'Options' & 'Build'.

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.12.17 (December 17, 2010)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS Editor]
ADD: Filter out bad characters from ExpressInstaller(.apz/.pgz) filenames.
FIX: A bug in replacing %AddonInstaller% variables that was adding a extra parameter space, which was causing
     _SetupS to fail. Also, changed _SetupS to trim those extra spaces (just in case).
FIX: A minor bug where if no BuildType.cmd/.reg already present then any other .cmd or .reg present would get
     copied to BuildType.cmd/.reg -- which would cause a problem if those files were supposed to be "auxillary"
     files and not a part of the regular SetupS install.
FIX: Another minor adjustment to the special %USERNAME% case when CurrentUser is "User".

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.11.15 (November 15, 2010)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS Editor]
ADD: Icon extaction tool (F10)
ADD: A very incomplete draft of the new Help Contents (F1). But it's a rough preview of what it'll entail.
CHANGE: Some minor cosmetics and facelifts.
CHANGE: Optimized deleting files during archive creation.

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.11.12 (November 12, 2010)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS Editor]
ADD: SetupS Variable %ProcessKill% (or %TaskKill%) to close a given process/task from a given filename. For example:
        <Install>
            %ProcessKill% "Notepad.exe"
ADD: Enabled build option LZMA2 compression method. Note: only the most up-to-date archive utilities (and of course
     the latest ssTek) can work with archives created with this method.
CHANGE: Converts any existing "PsKill.exe" or "TASKKILL.EXE /F /IM" to the new variable(s) %ProcessKill%/%TaskKill%.
CHANGE: Converts any existing "AddonInstaller.exe" to the (already existing) variable %AddonInstaller%.
CHANGE: Information about machine/OS architecture (x86/x64) that was in the <Flags> section is now in its own
        section called <Architecture>.

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.10.25 (October 25, 2010)
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS Editor]
ADD: New switches for Build automation:
    -Build :Tells ssEditor to build based on the current options/settings. Can be overridden with the following
            (optional) switches:
            -MakeExpressInstaller=off|on :"On" makes the .apz/pgz packages. "Off" forces building of ssWPI type
                packages instead.
            -ppCompress=off|on :Whether or not you want to use archives for ppApps or ppGames.
            -CalcMD5=off|on :Create MD5 checksums for the packages.
            -CompressionLevel=0|1|3|5|7|9 : 0=Store/Copy mode, 1=Fastest, 3=Fast, 5=Normal/Default, 7=Maximum,
                9=Ultra.
            -UseLZMA2=off|on :Toggle the use of the LZMA2 compression method.
            -UseOutputDir="{path}" :Specifies a destination folder for the builds (Note the quotes). Use an empty
                string "" to specify the source/input path for destination folder instead.

CHANGE: Menu bar overhaul.

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.10.10 (October 10, 2010)
---------------------------------------------

[SetupS Core/ALL]
ADD: An include library of common functions and declarations used by 'SetupS', 'SetupS Control Panel', 'SetupS
     Shortcuts Generator', and 'SetupS Editor'. This will improve performance, maintenance, scope, and overall
     readability. For example, it will improve the performance of the 'Shortcuts Generator' because it will no
     longer need to call the SetupS executable -- it calls the SetupS functions directly now.

ADD: New switch:
    -Verbose: Normally ON by default, this switch will force the reporting mode to use both Splash-text and
         Tray-Balloon tips.

ADD: Dual architecture capability for a universal ppApp environment, i.e., 32-bit ssTek will launch the 64-bit
     ssTek if it is present and the OS/Architecture warrants it.  Also extra switches related to launchers and/or
     ssWPI (which are only useful if operating in this mode):
         -Wait|NoWait: Depends whether or not you need to hold onto the 32-bit(x86) process and return to it after
             the 64-bit(x64) is finished. (Default is 'Wait').
         -KillLauncher={NameOfLauncher}|KillProcess={NameOfProcess}: If you need to close a launcher or process.
             Especially useful if using the 'NoWait' switch above.

ADD: x64 versions of SetupS, SetupS Control Panel, SetupS Shortcuts Generator, and 7-Zip.

ADD: <Version> section and a new function that tries to obtain the version from the <Title> -- not perfectly but it
     makes a pretty good guess most of the time.

CHANGE: Related to above... if <Version> section doesn't exit then it only gets created during ssEditor reads.
        Though the routine has been improved, there are still far too many exceptions to have to account for, so
        SetupS will leave <Title> alone when it makes a copy to the install path.

CHANGE: Related to above... <Version> tag is completed ignored for ppGames. (Not needed)

CHANGE: Now using 7-Zip exclusively for the distribution packages and Advanced StartMenus. Including the SFX ones.

CHANGE: Reverted ppApps/ppGames to using legacy section-names and keys as before so that the older Shortcut
        Generators and Launchers will work again. Now only ssApps/SetupS use <ShortcutS> with the new keys. And
        because only a few keys were renamed all the new features of SetupS are still retained.

CHANGE: Appending of the legacy <StartMenuDestPath> for advanced menu creation. As above, this is so that the older
        Shortcut Generators and Launchers will work again. Current ssTek will continue to use <Catalog> and it's
        features.

CHANGE: The optional SetupS.ini file is now also the default settings for all the SetupS project: 'SetupS', 'SetupS
        Control Panel', & 'SetupS Shortcuts Generator'. Note, as before, any switches/parameters passed will
        override this. Currently the only settings are the default notification/reporting mode for SetupS alone --
        such as for SendTo operations, etc.

FIX: x64-related folders are now taken into account for all path-related operations such as creating shortcuts and
     icons, locating installation paths, cleaning folders and files, etc.

FIX: The various handling of path information for the shortcut definitions in the saving of .app/.ppg files. Such
     as target & shortcut-name paths relative to the <AppPath> and/or the various %Variables% used like %ppApps%,
     etc.

[SetupS]
ADD: New SetupS switch -MenuCleaning=off|on. Updated Shortcuts.Generator to utilize this. This should slightly
     speed up the process of switching between (or resorting of) advanced menus.

ADD: SetupS can scan through folders for SetupS recognized files or folders. For example, right-click Sendto on
     one's "D:\ppApps" folder generates shortcuts; or on one's "E:\SetupSApps" will install all the apps in that
     folder.

CHANGE: For standard/default StartMenus, ppGames shortcuts now get placed into 'Programs\Games' (under their
        respective Category).

[SetupS Shortcuts Generator]
ADD: New switch:
    -AllDrives: To search all available drives for ppApps/ppGames folders. Otherwise, the default behavor is to
        just generate shortcuts only for known ppDrives set by SetupS Control Panel or ssWPI.

CHANGE: Shortcuts Generator now takes advantage of SetupS's ability to scan folders for .app's or .ppg's. This is
        likely a temporary change in the hopes of narrowing the possible conduits for bugs as the brunt of the work
        gets delegated to SetupS. [SetupS Shortcuts Generator]

[SetupS Control Panel]
ADD: Optical-drive (DVD/CD) selection.

ADD: Removal of .url files and shortcuts with .url targets.

ADD: A few extra default StartMenu shortcuts from the Windows 7 x64 edition.

FIX: Tamed LLCleaner to be less draconian in file removal. Now, in addition to dud link removal, it looks for
     .app/.ppg files for the installed-to path in which to delete (which means only SetupS apps & games will get
     deleted), then failing that only SetupS-related files get deleted, and finally any empty folders. [SetupS
     Control Panel/SuperLLClean]

[SetupS Editor]
ADD: Integrated ssEditor into the SetupS package. Can be used as the de facto editor for .app/.ppg files by a
     simple right-click "Edit" on those files. (Use of one�s favorite text-editor is retained through the use of
     "Open-with...")

ADD: A slightly modified MakeLists under Tools.

ADD: Optional Destination/Output folder for Builds (and Saving .app/.ppg files)

ADD: A screen-capture utility for SetupS Editor under Tools.

ADD: A 7-Zip progress bar with <Esc> to abort.

ADD: .reg/.cmd viewer buttons.

CHANGE: Optional compressing or creating the archive ssWPI 'install' package for ppApps or ppGames (the
        'ppApp.7z/ppGame.7z' files). Might be useful for LiveCD's for example.

CHANGE: 7-Zip archives are no longer solid which means individual files can be immediately be accessed or opened
        (without having to wait for any of the rest of the archive to extract).

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.6.0 (June 2010)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: Archives with the following extensions can be simply double-clicked on to install:
         .apz: SetupS apps, ssApps, or ppApps in zip, 7z, rar or any 7z recognized archive.
         .pgz: ppGames in zip, 7z, rar or any 7z recognized archive.
ADD: A fourth notification/reporting mode called SplashOnly (no tray/icon) with its corresponding switch:
     '--SplashOnly'.
ADD: Default settings for SetupS.exe by modifying the optional SetupS.ini file. Note, any switches/parameters
     passed will override this. Currently the only settings are the default notification/reporting mode for SetupS
     alone -- such as for SendTo operations, etc.
ADD: Preferences tab to 'SetupS Control Panel'. Currently the only settings are the default notification/reporting
     mode for SetupS alone -- such as for SendTo operations, etc.
FIX: 'Open With ...' text now references 'SetupS' (instead of description)
CHANGE: Improved location detection for use with Gnome desktops in Linux.

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.5.17 (17-May-2010) RC4
---------------------------------------------
FIX: ppApp/ppGame "installs" from any location (similarly as is done from a "ppAppsLive" folder).
FIX: 'LinuxSendTo' mod now allows spaces in paths.
CHANGE: Dropped 'SuperLLClean' from the install pack, as it was no longer needed.
FIX: Autosize ComboBox height so that 'SetupS Control Panel' works in Windows 2000 now.

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.5.15 (15-May-2010) RC3
---------------------------------------------
[SetupS Shortcuts Generator]
FIX: Shortcut Generator not finding Apps installed in system folders.

[SetupS Control Panel]
FIX: Copy, rather than move, 'Administrative Tools' shortcuts to their advanced StartMenu locations. Fixes a weird
     Vista/7 problem where other shortcuts, such as from context menus,  refererence those shortcuts instead of the
     App's or msc's themselves. Those with this problem, can recover their lost shortcuts simply by cycling through
     once an 'Uninstall Advanced StartMenu' and then back to their Advanced one. Note, on the Advanced StartMenus,
     that even though the 'Administrative Tools' shortcuts are hidden, they are still present.

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.5.14 (14-May-2010) RC2
---------------------------------------------
FIX: Removed splash "Initializing..." when help is displayed.
FIX: Miscellaneous Linux issues such as files getting deleted before Wine has had a chance to process them.
ADD: Implemented two methods of registry importing/merging in case one fails for any reason.
ADD: Slightly more informative error message boxes (instead of simply displaying the help text).

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.5.12 (12-May-2010) RC1
---------------------------------------------
CHANGE: Mostly cosmetics and some odds and ends; ie, the splashtext design(s), updated the help files, etc.

[SetupS]
CHANGE: Sets ppApps/ppGames drive if not already. Will speed up SetupS a little if it doesn't have to scan drives
        everytime it's used.

[SetupS Control Panel]
CHANGE: Swapped positions of "Okay" & "Cancel" buttons.

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.5.7 (8-May-2010)
---------------------------------------------
CHANGE: Standard/non-sorting menus reverts to (behaves as) the original system StartMenu "theme".

CHANGE: Separated the advanced menu creation & sorting from SetupS so that it returns to its original
        addon/extension/daemon capability. Besides being less bloated, all dependencies are now removed; this means
        SetupS can be once again be used by itself -- for example, in self-extracting (SFX) install packages.

ADD: 'SetupS Control Panel' is now at it's own application layer using SetupS as only one of its components. It
     also uses the 'SetupS Shortcut Generator' and 'Super LL Clean' as its other components. Evoking without
     switches will bring up the GUI for StartMenu preferences and ppDrive selections. For unattended installs, use
     these switches:
         -Mute (for totally silent installs)
         -Trayonly (show progress only as balloon tips from the tray)
         -[MenuName] (so far it's just the two to choose from:  ssTek or Kazz)
         -NoMenu (uninstalls the current advanced StartMenu)
         -MenuInstallOnly (for no sorting of Apps/ppGames shortcuts)
         -ReSort (Using the current StartMenu preference)
         -ppAppsDrive=[x]: (Sets desired ppApps Drive. Over-rides any current setting)
         -ppGamesDrive=[y]: (Sets desired ppGames Drive. Over-rides any current setting)
     Usage example: SetupSCP.exe --ssTek --Mute --ppGamesDrive=D:

ADD: 'LinuxSendTo' mod to the installer.

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.5.3 (3-May-2010)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: Multiple menu placements for shortcuts. Use "|" as delimiters between each location. For example:
    <StartMenuDestPath>
        3 Security\3 Firewall | 1 Internet\2 Network Tools
        - Security\- Firewall, Virus & Adware | - Internet\- Network and Bandwidth Software

ADD: Introducing "Menu Cataloging" that if used supersedes StartMenuDestPath for shortcut destinations. These will be detailed menu descriptions that are independent of the Advanced menu currently in use (if any). For example, the following will do the same thing as above:
    <Catalog>
        Security Firewall
        Network

The Menu descriptions are defined in the file "Definition.ini" in the respective Tools\Menu folder of choice. Using Kazz as an example:
    Security Firewall = 3 Security\3 Firewall
    Network = 1 Internet\2 Network Tools

ADD: Default shortcuts (Accessories, Administrator Tools, etc.) are better handled and sorted now. This includes shortcut moving from one Advanced menu to another (or no sorting/turned off). These are defined in the file "MenuDefaults.ini" located in the Tools folder and make use of the new "Menu Cataloging" (see above).

ADD: Tweaks can now be handled as ppApps. Previously they were SetupS/ssApp install types. Now they can be "activated" simply by running the ppApps shortcut generator. This is especially useful after a fresh OS install.

FIX: Script & registry handling where nothing would happen if no paths are provided except the source path that gets passed to SetupS anyway -- such as you would find in Tweaks and the like.

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.4.19 (19-Apr-2010)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: Replacement of single-slashes with double-slashes of system variables such as %SystemRoot% or %ProgramFiles%.
FIX: ppApp/ppGame "installs" from a backup location (similarly as is done from a "ppAppsLive" folder)
CHANGE: Reintroduced Shortcut Definitions method of handling of SetupS/ssApp shortcuts.
CHANGE: Handling of shortcut creation (for compatibility with Linux via Wine)

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.4.11 (11-Apr-2010)
---------------------------------------------
FIX: Standard (Non-Advanced menu) sorting especially unnecessary App folders.
FIX: Shortcut moving from one Advanced menu to another (or turning off).
FIX: Folder Icon creating for new or changed menu layouts.

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.4.9 (9-Apr-2010)
---------------------------------------------
FIX: Shortcut creating on Vista/7.
CHANGE: Updated SuperLLClean to handle Vista/7 shortcuts properly.
CHANGE: Miscellaneous advanced menus updating.
CHANGE: More selective and not so draconian in what gets deleted � such as shortcuts that were manually moved, etc.
CHANGE: Default shortcuts (Accessories, Administrator Tools, etc.) are remaining in their respective folders, for now � until there is better handling in place.

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.4.3 (3-Apr-2010)
---------------------------------------------
CHANGE: Menu structures returned to archived files to retain the file streams that were being lost via the InnoSetup installer.
CHANGE: Temporarily disabled SuperLLClean (as it's function is not need at this time anyway) to isolate some of the issues being experienced.

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.4.2 (2-Apr-2010)
---------------------------------------------
CHANGE: Method of handling of SetupS/ssApp shortcuts. Some shortcuts could not be created using the Shortcuts definition method. New method makes copies in the App's install folder. With a few exceptions, most Apps installed with v8.2.2.1 or later should still work with this version -- those that do NOT will need to be uninstalled then reinstalled with this version.
ADD: SuperLLClean to the mix for cleaning dud shortcuts from the StartMenu.
CHANGE: More improvements to the advanced menu handling.

---------------------------------------------
v8.10.4.1 (1-Apr-2010)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: SetupS/ssApp Shortcut Generator, and therefore, more active menu changes between Standard & Advanced menus. This means changing between menus (or even turning sorting off) also moves shortcuts as well.
NOTE: The above is only possible with (SetupS/ssApp) apps installed with SetupS v8.2.2.1 or higher -- and of course, any ppApps or ppGames installed with any version SetupS. Also, mainly XP focused (for now) -- Vista/7 refinements coming soon.
CHANGE: Version numbering scheme to reflect build-dates.
FIX: More bugs and tightening various nuts & bolts.

---------------------------------------------
v8.2.2.1 (30-Mar-2010)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: Shortcut creation from an already installed SetupS app (just like ppApps & ppGames). This should allow better re-placement of shortcuts to new or changed StartMenus for both standard and advanced menus. Also, SetupS/ssApp shortcut generators are now possible! NOTE: Only works for apps installed with SetupS v8.2.2.1 or higher.
CHANGE: New flags defs in the <Flags> section of .app/.ini files:
* MakeStartup/KeepInStartup -- create shortcut in Startup.
* NeverSort/NoMenuShortcuts/NoSorting -- do not do anything (extra) with the shortcuts. Essentially makes SetupS as standard Silent Installer. Note: This over-rides the AlwaysSort flag.
* KeepAllShortcuts -- retain all available shortcuts installed from App (not necessarily in original folder; see below).
* KeepInFolder -- selected shortcuts (from the <ShortcutsKeep> section) are kept in original folder. But only if combined with the KeepAllShortcuts flag -- otherwise, maintains the original default behavior of all shortcuts are kept in the original folder (the new equivalent of KeepAllShortcuts=1 AND KeepInFolder=1). These two flags used together will allow better control over shortcut placements.
FIX: Now correctly recognizes the program files "Nonething" app install path. Has the same effect as the NeverSort/NoMenuShortcuts flag (above). So be careful and watch out which apps are using this.
FIX: Better fail-safes and error-proofing, such as if an App has no actual installed-path then it won't try to move the user's "Programs" folder!

---------------------------------------------
v8.2.1.9 (20-Mar-2010)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: If an App (or Game) has its own StartMenu folder then it also gets an icon -- using the same corresponding .ico as in the App's (or Game's) installed folder.

---------------------------------------------
v8.2.1.8 (17-Mar-2010)
---------------------------------------------
FIX: Bug in the handling & sorting of standard (non-ssTek/Kazz) Start Menus -- incorrect destination variable used.
FIX: Bug in the handling of .app/.ini Sections with nothing between each section. For example:
    <FileTypes>
    <End>

---------------------------------------------
v8.2.1.7 (14-Mar-2010)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: Filetype association by filename extension for each app specified in the '<ppApp>' section; ie, Extension = .doc .txt .nfo... (Separate each extension with a space)
ADD: Comment lines in .app/.ini files. First character is ";"
FIX: Handling & sorting of standard (non-ssTek/Kazz) Start Menus and shortcuts for specialized locations: Desktop, QuickLaunch, SendTo, and Startmenu root("Programs").

---------------------------------------------
v8.2.1.5 (09-Mar-2010)
---------------------------------------------
CHANGE: Environment (ie, %SystemRoot%) and SetupS (ie, %ppApps%) variable substitutions are now handled within the separate file .cmd/.reg just like is done internally in the <Script>/<RegEntries> sections of the .app/.ini file.
ADD: Application path seek (for SetupS apps) whether or not it is incomplete in the <AppPath> section of the .app/.ini file.
ADD: Folder icon creation for SetupS/ssApp is included if a SetupS.ico is present.
FIX: Filetype association is now working (for SetupS apps).
FIX: Quickstart & Desktop shortcut creation is now working (for SetupS apps).

---------------------------------------------
v8.2.1.3 (08-Mar-2010)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: specify icon file for shortcuts (batch/.cmd files etc have no icons), file must be in app folder, icon must be '0' (first one), can be a dll, exe, icl or ico file. The line is added under the '<ppApp>' section with the other shortcut specs; ShortcutIcon = "FileWithIcon.ico". [AnneAadrvark]
FIX: Shortcut created in the SendTo folder had an invalid Arguments spec.

---------------------------------------------
v8.2.1.2 (27-Feb-2010)
---------------------------------------------
ADD: Folder icon creation for the installed folder if a corresponding .ico is present (SetupS.ico, ppApp.ico, ppGame.ico).
ADD: Switches "Kazz" and "ssTek" to force desired SetupS Start Menu sorting system. These can be used alone or with other parameters. Usage: "-KAZZ" or "-ssTek", etc.
ADD: Switch "-NoMenu" or "-NoSetupSMenu" to turn off SetupS Start Menu Sorting.
ADD: Switch "Help" or "?". Also displays help on improper SetupS usage.
CHANGE: Removed the recursive calling of SetupS with archived apps/games. Should make it more stable, easier to debug and maintain, and slightly faster since it won't need to reiterate everything all over again.
CHANGE: Reorganized/tightened-up some of the coding (for easier debugging and maintenance).

---------------------------------------------
v8.2.0.1 (21-Feb-2010)
---------------------------------------------
FIX: Archive handling was asynchronous -- created a problem if an application (or even via SendTo) sent archives to SetupS before the previous one(s) were finished.
CHANGE: Increased the traytip timeouts from 3 minutes to 5 minutes.

---------------------------------------------
v8.2.0.0 (19-Feb-2010)
---------------------------------------------
Using RON's SetupS v8.1.0.6 as the initial code base:
FIX: Installer will now first automatically uninstall previous (and current) versions of SetupS.
ADD: Optional "Arguments=" or "Parameters=" to ppApp/ppGame Shortcuts in the <ppApp> section of the ".app/.ini/.ppg" SetupS files.
FIX: Installs the appropriate and required menu structure (Kazz or ssTek), if the "systemfolder" structure is not present -- otherwise the StartMenu folder icon(s) creation fails without it.
ADD: The self-extracting files: "ssTekMenu.exe" & "KazzMenu.exe" To the "Tools" folder as per above.
FIX: Re-worked some of the "Desktop.ini" handling in the shortcut creation sections
ADD: A subroutine to extract the various archives SetupS might be asked to handle. Also, to maintain a v7 behavior where all the files in the archive did NOT need to be contained inside a subfolder.
CHANGE: Renamed some variables to more job-descriptive/specific; ie, "$Path" to "$SrcPath"
ADD: $CLIparameter array because $CMDLine is a constant and cannot be changed. Helpful for debugging, etc.
ADD: A Function to handle parameters/switches passed to SetupS
ADD: A command line switch for "-Mute" (or "-Quiet" or "-Silent") to make it totally silent including the system tray
FIX: Closed a file handle left open. Was preventing temp directory from being deleted till the next "run".
CHANGE: Slightly modified the various drive and path searches.
CHANGE: Slightly modified the recursive archive extraction section.
CHANGE: Slightly modified the "After Installer" section for a more thorough cleanup.
CHANGE: Added "@SW_HIDE" to the archive extraction command box
