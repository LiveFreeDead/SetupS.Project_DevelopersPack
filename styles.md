# Introduction
This document outlines the styles used in the coding
this ensures that developers follow a convention of formating and documenting code to ensure other people who try to develop understand how the code works and as we get older we have a tendancy to forget things so it essentical that we document everything.

## References
If you find a piece of code on some website then it would be wise to give a reference so oyhers can follow or look up on how to do it.

## Remarks
Remarks are always good to use on the headers of the code to describe the purpose of the code and provide the syntax used and what inputs are provided and why things are done a certain way.
